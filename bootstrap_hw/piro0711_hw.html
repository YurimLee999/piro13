                        The COVID-19 disaster, which hit the nation in late January, is estimated to have slashed the
                        number of temporary jobs in the services sector and prevented businesses from hiring new
                        employees. But unemployment among those under age 30 was already a critical social problem for
                        several years before the pandemic started.
